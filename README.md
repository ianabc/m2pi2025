# M2PI 2024 Python Course Notes

The notebooks in this directory were used to support the 2024 edition of the PIMS Math^Industry workshop. The LectureNotes directory has some material covering 

  * [numpy](./LectureNotes/numpy.ipynb)
  * [pandas](./LectureNotes/Pandas.ipynb)
  * [matplotlib](./LectureNotes/Matplotlib.ipynb)

The intention is to give m2pi participants a foundation for tackling the industry problems they will face in the following weeks of m2pi. 

Finally, there are also a couple of problem notebooks in the [PythonStdLib](./ProblemSession/PythinStdLib) directory. These are pure python exercises meant to accompany the [m2pi-python-self-study](https://github.com/ianabc/m2pi-python-self-study) course, they are not particularly relevant to the machine learning part of m2pi, but are included for completeness.
